# Login Flow

A showcase that demonstrates where I am struggling to understand how act-aaa works

* using [act-aaa](https://github.com/actframework/act-aaa-plugin) for authentication/authorisation
* an integrated development environment for API management and automate testing

## The idea

First click on the first link. Then you see that you are logged in. But you do not have permission.
Then click on the second link. You should still be logged in, but you are not. Why?

Furthermore what has to be done to get permission for this user? This might be due to the lack of an entry in the database. Is that the solution for the permission, or is there something else?
